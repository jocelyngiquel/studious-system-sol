# dump truck

A truck and pup is very similar to a transfer dump. It consists of a standard dump truck pulling a dump trailer. The pup trailer, unlike the transfer, has its own hydraulic ram and is capable of self-unloading.

Double and triple bottom dumps consist of a 2-axle tractor pulling one single-axle semi-trailer and an additional full trailer (or two full trailers in the case of triples). These dump trucks allow the driver to lay material in windrows without leaving the cab or stopping the truck. The main disadvantage is the difficulty in backing double and triple units.

Bumper Pull personal and commercial Dump Trailers come in a variety of sizes from smaller 6x10 7,000 GVWR models to larger 7x16 High Side 14,000 GVWR models.

Dump trailers come with a range of options and features such as tarp kits, high side options, dump/spread/swing gates, remote control, scissor, telescop, dual or single cylinder lifts, and metal locking toolboxes. They offer the perfect solution for a variety of applications, including roofing, rock and mulch delivery, general contractors, skid steer grading, trash out, and recycling.

Many winter service vehicles are based on dump trucks, to allow the placement of ballast to weigh the truck down or to hold sodium or calcium chloride salts for spreading on snow and ice-covered surfaces. Plowing is severe service and needs heavy-duty trucks.
